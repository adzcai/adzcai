### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alex (he/him)! I'm currently a high school student from Edmonton, Alberta who enjoys playing with code alongside music and RPGs.

### What interests me

Some (programming) topics I'm currently interested in:
- Artificial intelligence and machine learning
- Functional programming (through Haskell)
- Systems-level programming (through Rust)
- Cybersecurity

Some (other) topics I'm currently interested in:
- The Universal Decimal Classification System
- Learning German

### What I do

I'm currently the Co-President of Math Attack Society, a Canadian, student-led, non-profit organization that aims to break down barriers in the world of math through team contests and impactful proactive mentoring. Find out more at <http://mathattacksociety.org/>!

Last summer, I also had the chance to research at the University of Alberta (Faculty of Computing Science). I co-authored "A tardiness-augmented approximation scheme for rejection-allowed multiprocessor rescheduling", which is currently under review at [Computers and Industrial Engineering](https://www.computers-and-ie.org/).

### Currently reading

- Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Philip K. Dick
- A Short History of Chinese Philosophy by Fung Yu-Lan

Recently finished the current ASOIAF books and can't wait for George R. R. Martin to finish up The Winds of Winter.

Feel free to message me through Discord at acai.pie#5589!

Keep calm and code on!
