### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alex (he/him)! I'm currently a high school student from Edmonton, Alberta who enjoys playing with code alongside music and RPGs. I enjoy studying linguistics and constructing languages in my spare time.

### What interests me

Some (programming) topics I'm currently interested in:
- Artificial intelligence and machine learning
- Functional programming (through Haskell)
- Systems-level programming (through Rust and C++)
- Cybersecurity
- WebAssembly

### Some technologies I work with

- Modern JavaScript: TypeScript, GraphQL, React. Opinion: Writing it is fun but I think it's reached a threshold of abstraction we don't want to push.
- C++ for algorithms and low-level programming. Experienced with Boost.
- Python for data science and machine learning. Experienced with numerous data science libraries including pandas, TensorFlow, and scikit-learn.
