### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alex (he/him)! I'm currently a high school student from Edmonton, Alberta who enjoys playing with code alongside music and RPGs.

### What interests me

Some (programming) topics I'm currently interested in:
- Artificial intelligence and machine learning
- Functional programming (through Haskell)
- Systems-level programming (through Rust)
- Cybersecurity
- WebAssembly

### Some technologies I work with

- Modern JavaScript: TypeScript, GraphQL, React. Opinion: Writing it is fun but I think it's reached a threshold of abstraction we don't want to push.
- C++ for algorithms and such.
- Python for data science and machine learning.
